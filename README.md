## Project Overview

Cardiovascular diseases are one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early prediction and diagnosis can significantly improve treatment outcomes. In this project, we explore different machine learning models to predict the presence of heart disease based on clinical features.

## Dataset

- **Name:** UCI Heart Disease Dataset
- **Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease)
- **Features:** Age, Sex, Chest pain type, Resting blood pressure, Cholesterol, Fasting blood sugar, Resting ECG results, Max heart rate, Exercise-induced angina, Oldpeak, Slope, Number of vessels, Thalassemia.

## Technologies and Libraries Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost

## Machine Learning Models Applied

- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
## Steps Performed

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**  
   Load the dataset and perform an initial data analysis.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical features
   - Feature scaling

3. **Model Building and Evaluation**  
   Train multiple models and evaluate them using:
   - Accuracy Score
   - Classification Report
   - Confusion Matrix

4. **Model Comparison**  
   Compare models based on performance metrics.
